Codecademy: Tea Cozy Project

The assignment: Create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.

Codecademy provided a design spec and image assets use in the design. This project was to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.

The design spec is available at: https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg
